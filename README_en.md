# AutoGluon on AWS Hands-on Lab

## Introduction
    
AutoGluon is an open source AutoML toolkit built on AWS that provides a variety of recipes and best practices for easily training and deploying high-quality models from Business Analysts to Machine Learning experts

With this hands-on, you can easily train tabular & unstructured (Text, Image) data with AutoGluon with only a few lines of code, and perform optimal network search and optimal hyperparameter search while learning the basic usage of AutoGluon.

Hands-on codes do not need to be executed sequentially or all, but for smooth hands-on, it is recommended to execute [1.tabular/01_binary_classification.ipynb](1.tabular/01_binary_classification.ipynb) first.
